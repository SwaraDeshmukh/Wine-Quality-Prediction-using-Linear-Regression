## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. Using the Wine Quality dataset, we train a Linear Regression model to estimate the quality ratings of wine samples. This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset, which includes features such as acidity, sugar content, pH level, and other chemical properties of wine. The target variable is the quality rating of the wine. The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).
